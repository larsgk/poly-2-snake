# Polymer 2 snake

Just wait - it will be awesome (hopefully :))

TODO:

* triangular coords (including grid/gamearea)
* Proper color maps
* Collision detection, etc.
* Input: keyboard, mouse, touch, accelerometer (incl. WebUSB & empiriKit|MOTION)
* Decision on canvas (full control, 2D or 3D) vs svg (clean if works) vs dom elements (tricky but cool)
* WebAudio stuffs
